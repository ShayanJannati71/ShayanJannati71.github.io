## Overview
Developing in vitro models that mimic native cardiac tissue is challenging.  
This project focused on creating a **soft micropatterned substrate** to guide the alignment and maturation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.  

---

## Methods
- Designed a **transparent PDMS substrate** with tunable stiffness.  
- Applied micropatterning techniques to control cell alignment.  
- Cultured hiPSC-CMs on both **patterned** and **unpatterned** surfaces.  

---

## Results
- **Enhanced alignment** and **synchronous contractions** on patterned substrates.  
- Improved **functional maturity** compared to controls.

## Impact
Provides a reproducible platform for **disease modeling, drug testing, and cardiac tissue engineering**.
