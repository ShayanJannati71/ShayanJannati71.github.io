## Objective  
The objective of this project was to **measure the mechanical properties of cardiac myofibrils** (lab-grown heart cell fibers) using a custom-designed experimental setup. The study integrated **micromechanical force measurement** with **viscoelastic modeling** to quantify stress-strain behavior and time-dependent relaxation.

## Experimental Setup  
A highly sensitive force measurement system was implemented to probe the mechanics of individual cardiac myofibrils. The setup included a cantilever and microneedle system coupled with an inverted optical microscope and live force feedback.

## Stress-Relaxation Measurements  
Multiple strain levels (5–90%) were applied to the cardiac myofibrils. The stress response was recorded over time to capture viscoelastic relaxation behavior.

## Viscoelastic Modeling  
The experimental stress-relaxation data were fit to viscoelastic models to extract mechanical parameters such as elastic modulus, viscosity, and relaxation time constants.
