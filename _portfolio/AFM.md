## Objective  
To quantify the **mechanical behavior of cardiac myofibrils** derived from human induced pluripotent stem cell cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) using **atomic force microscopy (AFM)** and to model their elastic and viscous responses with a **Quasi-Linear Viscoelastic (QLV) model**.  

---

## Experimental Setup  
- Myofibrils were mounted between a **glass needle** and an **AFM cantilever**.  
- Stressâ€“relaxation tests were performed at multiple strain levels.  
- Porcine ventricular myofibrils were used for comparison and validation.

## Key Findings  
- The **elastic modulus** of hiPSC-CM myofibrils was about **10 kPa**, consistent with the stiffness of adult human heart myofibrils.  
- hiPSC-CM myofibrils exhibited **slower relaxation dynamics** compared to porcine tissue, especially within the first 0.25 s after stretch.  
- The **QLV model** accurately captured both **elastic and viscous responses** across tested strain ranges.

## Outcome  
- First study to characterize **viscoelastic properties of hiPSC-CM myofibrils**.  
- Provides insights into the **mechanical behavior of heart muscle at the microscale**, with implications for disease modeling and therapy development.
