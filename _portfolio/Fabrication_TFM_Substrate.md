## Objective  
To fabricate and optimize PDMS-based substrates embedded or functionalized with fluorescent beads for **traction force microscopy (TFM)** and live-cell mechanical studies.  

## Outcome  
- Established reliable protocols for **embedding fluorescent beads** into PDMS substrates using different solvents (DI water, methanol, and reconstituted dried beads).  
- Developed **surface functionalization strategies** (APTES-based coating, encapsulation with thin PDMS layers, and DMSO/PAA-assisted deposition).  
- Identified **APTES-based functionalization** as the most consistent method for achieving uniform bead distribution.  
- Enabled high-resolution TFM imaging for quantifying cellular traction forces on micropatterned substrates.

**Figure 3.** Strategies for embedding and functionalizing fluorescent beads in PDMS substrates.  
- **Panel A:** Embedding within PDMS using (i) DI water, (ii) methanol-based solution, or (iii) dried beads reconstituted in methanol.  
- **Panel B:** Functionalization on PDMS surface via (i) APTES-based coating, (ii) encapsulation with thin PDMS layer, or (iii) DMSO/PAA-assisted deposition.

## Methods Summary  
- Fluorescent beads (0.2 μm, Invitrogen FluoSpheres™) were dispersed in solvents (DI water, methanol, or DMSO) and incorporated into PDMS (Sylgard 184 or 527).  
- Mixtures were homogenized, filtered, and cured under controlled conditions (60–65 °C) to ensure bead stability and substrate uniformity.  
- Coverslips were plasma-treated and coated with sacrificial or functional layers (e.g., PVA, PAA, APTES) to improve adhesion and control bead distribution.  
- Imaging confirmed that **APTES-treated PDMS surfaces** yielded the most uniform fluorescent bead dispersion, supporting long-term live-cell imaging.

## Impact  
These optimized substrates enable **traction force microscopy on micropatterned cardiac cell platforms**, improving measurement accuracy of cell-generated stresses.  
They provide a reproducible and scalable fabrication route for **biomechanics, drug screening, and cardiac tissue engineering applications**.
