## Overview
This project focused on automating the functional analysis of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes using **computer vision** techniques.  

---

## Methods
- Implemented the **SarcTrack pipeline** based on double-wavelet fitting.  
- Analyzed Z-line dynamics across large imaging datasets.  
- Extracted contractile parameters at single-cell and population scale.  

---

## Results
- Quantified:
  - Sarcomere shortening  
  - Maximum contraction and relaxation velocity  
  - Minimum and maximum sarcomere length
