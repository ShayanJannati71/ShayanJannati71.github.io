## Objective  
To measure sarcomere dynamics (length, contraction, and relaxation velocities) in hiPSC-CMs using the **SarcTrack** algorithm for automated image-based analysis.  

## Methods  
- **Imaging:** GFP-tagged Z-lines imaged in hiPSC-CMs.  
- **Double-wavelet fitting:** Tracks distances between adjacent Z-lines across frames.  
- **Data processing:** Extracts frame-by-frame sarcomere lengths, then averages across cells.  
- **Outputs:**  
  - Maximum and minimum sarcomere length  
  - Peak contraction velocity  
  - Peak relaxation velocity

*Figure 1: SarcTrack workflow. GFP-tagged Z-lines are tracked across frames using double-wavelet fitting, yielding sarcomere length traces for contractionâ€“relaxation cycles.*  

## Outcomes  
- Enabled **high-throughput, automated analysis** of sarcomere contraction.  
- Provided quantitative insights into **cellular contractility and disease phenotypes** in hiPSC-CMs.  
- Forms a foundation for **AI-augmented sarcomere analysis pipelines** in future work.
