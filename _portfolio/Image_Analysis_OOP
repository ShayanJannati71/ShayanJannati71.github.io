## Objective  
Develop an automated pipeline for measuring the orientation of cardiac cells cultured on micropatterned substrates.  

## Impact  
- Provides objective and reproducible **orientation metrics** of cardiac cells.  
- Enables **high-throughput screening** of alignment across different substrate conditions.  
- Supports the study of how microenvironmental cues guide **cellular organization**.

**Figure 2.** Representative results of orientation analysis:  
- (i) Original Î±-actinin2 (green) images with nuclei (blue).  
- (ii) Processed skeletonized Z-lines.  
- (iii) Orientational maps showing alignment with micropattern direction.  
- (iv) Polar plots and order parameter analysis quantifying alignment across regions.

## Impact  
This automated workflow provides a robust method to **quantify cardiac cell orientation** at scale.  
It can be applied to optimize **micropatterning strategies**, evaluate **substrate designs**, and study **mechanobiological responses** in cardiac tissue engineering.
