## Objective
To classify different locomotion modes using Electromyography (EMG) signals through Support Vector Machines (SVM), enabling precise and adaptive control of prosthetic devices.


## Methods

*Figure 2: Uniaxial test results and fitting of experimental data using three hyperelastic models. (A) RMSE criteria for fitting the experimental data with three different hyperelastic models: Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and One-term Ogden, across three different PDMS formulations: Soft PDMS 527, Stiff PDMS 10:1 (527:184), and PDMS 5:1 (527:184). The One-term Ogden model is considered to have the lowest RMSE.*
