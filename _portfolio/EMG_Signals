### Objectives  
This project focused on leveraging surface electromyography (sEMG) signals for two primary goals:  
1. Classifying different locomotion modes using machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machines (SVM).  
2. Estimating knee joint kinematics through neural network–based modeling to provide a reliable, non-invasive method for prosthetic control, rehabilitation, and human–machine interaction.  

### Methods  
- **Signal Acquisition & Processing:** sEMG signals were collected and pre-processed with filtering and normalization.  
- **Segmentation & Feature Extraction:** Time-series EMG data were segmented, and relevant features were extracted for analysis.  
- **Model Development:**  
  - **Locomotion Classification:** SVM was applied to classify locomotion modes.  
  - **Kinematics Estimation:** A Time-Delay Artificial Neural Network (TDANN) was designed to model nonlinear relationships between sEMG inputs and knee joint angles.  
- **Evaluation:** Performance was measured using the coefficient of determination ($R^2$), with experiments assessing the effects of varying delays and neuron counts on model accuracy.  

### Outcomes  
- SVM-based classification enabled accurate differentiation between locomotion modes.  
- Increasing the number of delays reduced predictive accuracy, highlighting the importance of optimized temporal windowing.  
- The TDANN achieved its best performance with approximately 60 neurons, yielding $R^2 \approx 0.85$ for knee angle prediction.  
- Predicted knee angle trajectories closely matched target angles after filtering, demonstrating the robustness of the approach.
