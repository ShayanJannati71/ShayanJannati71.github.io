## Objective
The primary objective of this study was to estimate knee joint kinematics using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. By leveraging neural network–based modeling, the aim was to establish a reliable, non-invasive approach for predicting knee joint angles that could support applications in rehabilitation, prosthetics, and human–machine interaction.

## Methods
## Knee Joint Kinematics Estimation Using sEMG

### Objectives  
The objective of this project was to estimate knee joint kinematics using surface electromyography (sEMG) signals. By employing neural network–based modeling, the goal was to develop a reliable, non-invasive method for predicting knee joint angles to support applications in rehabilitation, prosthetics, and human–machine interaction.  

### Methods  
- **Signal Acquisition & Processing:** sEMG signals were acquired and pre-processed through filtering and normalization.  
- **Segmentation & Feature Extraction:** Time-series sEMG data were segmented, and key features were extracted.  
- **Model Development:** A Time-Delay Artificial Neural Network (TDANN) was implemented to capture the nonlinear relationship between sEMG inputs and knee joint angles. Different delay parameters and neuron counts were tested to optimize performance.  
- **Evaluation:** Model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination ($R^2$). Experiments analyzed the effect of varying the number of delays and neurons on estimation accuracy.  

### Outcomes  
- Increasing the number of delays reduced predictive accuracy, emphasizing the importance of selecting an optimal temporal window.  
- The best performance was achieved with approximately 60 neurons, yielding $R^2 \approx 0.85$ for knee angle prediction.  
- Predicted knee angle trajectories showed strong agreement with the target angles after filtering, demonstrating the robustness of the TDANN approach.
