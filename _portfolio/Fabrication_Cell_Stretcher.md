## Objective  
To design and develop a versatile cell stretcher system for controlled mechanical stimulation of biological samples during live imaging.  
*This work was carried out as a UBC Mechanical Engineering Capstone Project in collaboration with the MEMS Lab.*  

## Outcome *(in progress)*  
- Supports customizable stretching protocols  
- Enables real-time imaging on inverted microscopes  
- Compatible with stage-top incubators  
- Integrates with multiple chamber types and stimulation modalities  
- Aimed at advancing research in cell mechanics and cardiac biology
