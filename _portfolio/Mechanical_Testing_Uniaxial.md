*Figure 2: Uniaxial test results and fitting of experimental data using three hyperelastic models. (A) RMSE criteria for fitting the experimental data with three different hyperelastic models: Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and One-term Ogden, across three different PDMS formulations: Soft PDMS 527, Stiff PDMS 10:1 (527:184), and PDMS 5:1 (527:184). The One-term Ogden model is considered to have the lowest RMSE.*

## Objective
Characterize soft elastomeric substrates using uniaxial testing and compare different hyperelastic models.

## Methods
- Uniaxial tensile testing of soft PDMS substrates  
- Curve fitting to hyperelastic models (Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, One-term Ogden)  
- Model selection based on goodness-of-fit criteria  

## Outcome
The One-term Ogden model provided the best fit, accurately capturing the nonlinear stress-strain behavior of soft elastomers.
