title: "Hyperelastic Modeling of Soft Elastomeric Material"
excerpt: "Characterizing soft elastomers using uniaxial testing and hyperelastic models."
---
## Objective
Characterize the mechanical properties of soft elastomeric substrates (e.g., PDMS) using uniaxial tensile testing and compare their behavior with various hyperelastic models to accurately replicate the stiffness range of native cardiac tissue.

## Methods
- Uniaxial tensile testing of soft PDMS substrates  
- Curve fitting to hyperelastic models (Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, One-term Ogden)  
- Model selection based on goodness-of-fit criteria

*Figure 2: Uniaxial test results and fitting of experimental data using three hyperelastic models. (A) RMSE criteria for fitting the experimental data with three different hyperelastic models: Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, and One-term Ogden, across three different PDMS formulations: Soft PDMS 527, Stiff PDMS 10:1 (527:184), and PDMS 5:1 (527:184). The One-term Ogden model is considered to have the lowest RMSE.*



## Outcome
The One-term Ogden model provided the best fit, accurately capturing the nonlinear stress-strain behavior of soft elastomers.
