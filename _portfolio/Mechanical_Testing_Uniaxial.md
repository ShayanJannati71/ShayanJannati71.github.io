## Objective
Characterize soft elastomeric substrates using uniaxial testing and compare different hyperelastic models.

## Methods
- Uniaxial tensile testing of soft PDMS substrates  
- Curve fitting to hyperelastic models (Neo-Hookean, Mooney-Rivlin, One-term Ogden)  
- Model selection based on goodness-of-fit criteria  

## Outcome
The One-term Ogden model provided the best fit, accurately capturing the nonlinear stress-strain behavior of soft elastomers.
