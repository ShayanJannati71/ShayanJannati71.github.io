## Objective
Develop a soft micropatterned PDMS substrate to support maturation of hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

## Methods
- Tunable PDMS stiffness (5 kPa â€“ 1 GPa)
- Micropatterning for cell alignment
- Live cell imaging and AI-based contractility analysis

## Outcome
- Improved alignment and stronger contractions  
- High-resolution imaging enabled detailed analysis  
- Published in *Acta Biomaterialia*
