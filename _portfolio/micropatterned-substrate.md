## Overview
Developing in vitro models that faithfully mimic native cardiac tissue remains a major challenge.  
This project focused on creating a **soft micropatterned substrate** to guide the alignment and maturation of human induced pluripotent stem cell–derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs).  

---

## Methods
- Designed and fabricated a **transparent PDMS-based micropatterned substrate** with tunable stiffness.  
- Cultured hiPSC-CMs on both **patterned** and **unpatterned** surfaces.  
- Evaluated **structural organization** and **functional contractility** using live-cell imaging and quantitative analysis.  

---

## Results
- **Enhanced alignment** of cardiomyocytes on patterned substrates compared to controls.  
- **Improved contractile strength and synchronization**, supporting more physiologically relevant cardiac models.

## Impact
This platform provides researchers with a reproducible method to improve the maturity of stem cell–derived heart cells.  
It enables more accurate **disease modeling**, **drug testing**, and **cardiac tissue engineering** applications.
