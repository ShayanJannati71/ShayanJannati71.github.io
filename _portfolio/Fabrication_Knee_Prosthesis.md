## Objectives  
This project focused on the **design and fabrication of a knee prosthesis prototype** based on a **Series Elastic Actuator (SEA)** architecture. The SEA configuration provides compliance through elastic elements, enabling safer and more natural torque transfer in assistive and prosthetic devices.  

---

## Electrical and Control Subsystems  
Key components of the prosthesis include sensors, motor drivers, and embedded controllers for precise actuation and feedback.

## Mechanical Components  
The mechanical assembly consists of CNC-machined aluminum brackets, couplers, linear bearings, pulleys, and springs. These parts were fabricated and organized to streamline the assembly process.

## Series Elastic Actuator Concept  
The SEA design places a compliant spring between the actuator and load, enabling torque sensing through deflection while reducing shock loads on the motor.
